#### Project Name:
* 🌎 ⭐ ***Intra-galactic Planetary Data Hub (GPD)*** ⭐ 🌎

#### Loose Pitch:
* "A user-friendly web app for exploring exoplanets"

#### Specific Pitch:
* "The Intra-galictic Planetary Data Hub" is a user-friendly web app that consumes the NASA Exoplanet Archive API. It ***WOWs*** users by Displaying the most recently discovered planet on the **"landing" page**. The app includes a **"dropdown" menu** to other pages/interactivity of the site. A **"table" page** will list and sort planets, allowing users to change and view planets in useful ways. From the table's page, users will be able to select a specific planet, which will trigger an additional GET request for details of a specific planet. This action will take them to the **"Details"** Page. Enhanced features will include a **"comparative" page**, relating exoplanets to planets within our own solar system. All done with the light-weight built-in powers of HTML5, CSS3 and ES6+ JavaScript!"
